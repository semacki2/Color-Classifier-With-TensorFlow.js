    This application trains an artificail neural network in real time to identify colors.
  <br>
    We use TensorFlow.js to create and train the model.
  <br>
    We use the colorData.json dataset from Coding Train to train the model.
  <br>
    What you see is the current prediction and confidence.
  <br>
    Because the model is training in real time, the prediction and confidence will change. 
  <br>
    It should become more stable the longer you let the application run.
