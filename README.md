# Color-Classifier-With-TensorFlow.js
Simple implementation of a color classifier. Built with p5.js and TensorFlow.js. 

The model is trained in real time using a local JSON file provided by Daniel Shiffman (Coding Train). 

The longer you leave the application running, the better the model will be at identifying the color you've chosen. 

Change the color by manipulating the sliders.
